SOBI 2 - Sigsiu Online Business Index 2 is a directory component for the WCMS Mambo and Joomla!  to show entries of companies, clubs, persons, shops, products, aso.
The entries are divided into categories, which can contain subcategories. One entry can be entered in up to five categories. The companies/clubs/persons enter themselves in the index. A security code (security image) is available for spam protection. Registered users can modify or delete their entries.

Using the integrated Category&Entry Manager in the back-end all categories and entries can be managed comfortably. Entries and categories can be deleted, unpublished and moved.

A Field Manager can be used to configure each field entirely. This concerns the ordering, obligatory fields, fees, field length (width of field and number of characters), field type (textfield, textarea, checkbox, checkbox group, select list, text code or calendar), search methods, in which view a field should be shown (cards view and/or Details View), and much more. An unlimited number of new custom fields can be added.

For each entry two images can be uploaded (besides the linked images in the description). The images will be resized to an adjusted size. With the URL field "image" it is possible to add fields for linked images.

An alpha index is available to show only entries starting with a specified letter. Also only the most popular entries and categories, the recently updated entries, the new entries or entries by tags (mata keywords) can be shown.

To let the customer pay for the not for free options easily, a connection to PayPal is integrated.

In a menu module all categories can be shown in tree view or all main categories in a flat view. An extended search function gives the possibility to search within the existing values of one or more fields or within a specific category.
